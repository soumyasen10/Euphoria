# Euphoria E-commerce Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Euphoria E-commerce project, please email us at `spectra.shohan@gmail.com`. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond to your report within 24 hours.

Please include the following information in your report:

- A brief description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Possible impact of the vulnerability
- Your name and contact information

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to investigate and address it.

## Security Best Practices

We take security seriously and expect all contributors to the Euphoria E-commerce project to follow these best practices:

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and services
- Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts and services where possible
- Keep your local development environment and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches
- Avoid committing sensitive information (such as passwords, API keys, or access tokens) to the project repository
- Use encryption when transmitting sensitive data (such as passwords or payment information)
- Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to systems or data
- Regularly audit access logs and monitor for suspicious activity
- Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between clients and the server

## Code Review Process

All code changes to the Euphoria E-commerce project must be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before being merged into the main branch. Code reviewers should pay particular attention to security-related issues, such as:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper use of encryption and hashing algorithms
- Avoiding SQL injection and other common web application attacks
- Proper error handling and logging
- Avoiding hardcoded passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information
- Use of third-party libraries and dependencies, and their security posture

## Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies

We strive to use only third-party libraries and dependencies with a proven track record of security and stability. However, we recognize that no software is perfect, and vulnerabilities may arise.

We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them to the latest stable versions as needed. If you discover a vulnerability in a third-party library or dependency used in the Euphoria E-commerce project, please let us know at `spectra.shohan@gmail.com`.
